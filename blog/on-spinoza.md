# On Spinoza (Baruch)

Hightlights:

*From wikipedia*

  > he utterly rejected their contention that reason could defeat emotion. On
  > the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by
  > a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and
  > passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and
  > the latter those that are not.

  > Spinoza held good and evil to be relative concepts, claiming that nothing
  > is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity. Things
  > that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply
  > good or bad for humans.

  > Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful
  > for rhetoric, is inadequate for discovering universal truth.

  > Spinoza as part of the tradition of Enlightenment rationalism that
  > eventually produced Modernity -- Leo Strauss

  > "Man is always necessarily a prey to his passions"
